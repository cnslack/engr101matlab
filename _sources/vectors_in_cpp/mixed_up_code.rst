These questions are **completely OPTIONAL**. We provide these exercises to give you more practice with the material that you've learned. 
Additionally, they may be a helpful resource when reviewing for assessments. Some lines contain **mistakes** or are **unnecessary** for 
the function - these lines should not be selected. Make sure to place the blocks at the right indentation levels!

    Construct a block of code that loops over a vector called ``numbers``, initialized as ``{1,2,3,4,5}``,
    and transforms the vector so each element is doubled. Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
