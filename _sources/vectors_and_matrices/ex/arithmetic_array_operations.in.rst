Assume you have these variables :code:`a`, :code:`b`, :code:`c`, and :code:`d`:

For each of the expressions below, determine the result of the operation (or if there is an error, explain what is wrong). There's also a MatCrab workspace below the questions you can use to check your work, if you like.

.. tip::
  If you're working on a laptop, you can open this page in two windows side-by-side so that you can view the content above and the questions below at the same time!

.. list-table::

  * - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_01

        What is the result of :code:`a * b`?

    - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_02

        What is the result of :code:`b - c .* 2`?

  * - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_03

        What is the result of :code:`d ./ c`?

    - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_04

        What is the result of :code:`a + d`?

  * - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_05

        What is the result of :code:`10 - d`?

    - .. shortanswer:: ch02_03_ex_arithmetic_array_operations_06

        What is the result of :code:`a .* b`?

MatCrab can help you check any of your work above, if you would like. (To get it to show the result, make sure to store your result in a variable, e.g. :code:`result = a .* b`.)
