The questions below will ask you to write code that works regardless of the size of a matrix. Feel free to use this MatCrab workspace to try out your solutions on matrices :code:`a`, :code:`b`, and :code:`c`. (Or even other matrices if you would like to create more!)

.. raw:: html

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="matcrab-example">
      <div class="matcrab-setup">
        a = [1,4,5];
        b = [1,5,7;2,6,7];
        c = [1;4;5];
      </div>
      <table><tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">
            <img src="../_static/common/img/crabster.jpg" style="height: 35px" />
            <br />
            <a role="button" class="btn btn-warning matcrab-reset">Reset</a>
          </td>

            </textarea>
            <div class="matcrab-vis" style="width: 400px; height: 200px">

.. shortanswer:: ch02_06_ex_manipulating_arrays_04

  Say you have a matrix :code:`m`. Write a line of code to create a new matrix (choose any name you like) from only the odd numbered columns in :code:`m`. Your code should work regardless of the size of :code:`m`.

.. shortanswer:: ch02_06_ex_manipulating_arrays_05

  Say you have a matrix :code:`m`. Write a line of code to set the elements in the four corners of :code:`m` to the value 0. Your code should work regardless of the size of :code:`m`.

.. shortanswer:: ch02_06_ex_manipulating_arrays_03

  Say you have a matrix :code:`m`. Write a line of code to double the value of each element in the first row of :code:`m`. Your code should work regardless of the size of :code:`m`.
