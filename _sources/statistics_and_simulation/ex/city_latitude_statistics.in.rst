This exercise uses :file:`cities.xslx` and :file:`CityLatitudes.m` (available at the top of the chapter).

Open :file:`CityLatitudes.m` in MATLAB. We've provided an outline for your code, as well as initial code to read data from the Excel file, :file:`cities.xlsx`, and extract the data into three parallel vectors :code:`pop`, :code:`lat`, and :code:`lon` representing the cities' populations, latitudes, and longitudes, respectively. (Don't worry about how specifically the :code:`xlsread` function works - we'll come back to this in a later chapter.)

Fill in the missing code to generate some basic statistical measures of the latitudes of the world's largest cities. Answer the questions below based on your analysis.
