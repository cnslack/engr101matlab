In this exercise, you'll work with the ESP data and write a function to compute the average ESP value for a given month. Make sure that you've downloaded :code:`daily_samples.csv` and :code:`ESP.m` from the beginning of the chapter.

Create a new function file called :file:`monthlyAverage.m`.

In that file, define the function :code:`monthlyAverage()`. It takes in a vector of 360 ESP values and a month number (e.g. 1 is January, 12 is December) and returns the average of ESP values for samples during the given month. For example, given the :code:`esp` vector, you could call :code:`monthlyAverage(esp, 3)` to compute the average ESP during March (the 3rd month).

**Step 1**

To find the range of days to average based on the month (reminder: we're assuming all months have 30 days), use these formulas:

* :code:`startDay = 30*(month-1) + 1;`
* :code:`endDay = startDay + 29;`

**Step 2**

To compute the average, use MATLAB's built-in :code:`mean()` function on a subvector of the ESP values selected according to the range of days you just computed.

    Use indexing and range notation to select the subvector of values to average. For example, to select values for January, you could write :code:`data(1:30)`. Of course, you don't want to hardcode :code:`1:30` - instead use your variables containing the appropriate :code:`startDay` and :code:`endDay`.

  Paste in a copy of your :file:`monthlyAverage.m` function file.

Finally, call your :code:`monthlyAverage()` function at the end of your :file:`AnalyzeESP.m` script to compute and print the average ESP in months 1 and 7. Run the script to find the answer to the question below.
