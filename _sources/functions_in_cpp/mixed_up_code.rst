   Vacation time! But before you go, you need to convert your currency.
   Let's write the code for the dollarToYen function. ``dollarToYen``
   takes ``dollar`` as a parameter and returns the equivalent amount of Japanese yen.
   The conversion rate is 1 USD equals 105.42 Japanese yen.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   double dollarToYen (double dollar) {
   =====
   int dollarToYen (double dollar) {  #distractor
   =====
   void dollarToYen (double dollar) {  #distractor
   =====
   double dollarToYen () {  #distractor
   =====
      double yen;  #distractor
   =====
      return 105.42 * dollar;
   =====
      return 105.42 * yen;  #distractor
   =====
   }

   When you buy something, you usually need to pay sales tax. For example,
   a nice shirt could be labeled with a price of exactly $20, but when 
   you pay, you actually need to pay $21.20 in a state with 6% sales tax.
   However, different states have different tax rates. Write the function
   ``priceWithTax``, which takes ``price`` and ``percentTax`` as parameters.
   ``priceWithTax`` calculates the price after tax and returns it.
   For example, ``priceWithTax (20, 6)`` returns 21.2.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   double priceWithTax (double price, double percentTax) {
   =====
   int priceWithTax (double price, int percentTax) {  #distractor
   =====
   double priceWithTax (price, percentTax) {  #distractor
   =====
      return (1 + percentTax / 100) * price;
   =====
      return (1 + percentTax) * price;  #distractor
   =====
      return percentTax * price;  #distractor
   =====
   }

   Most assignments and tests are graded as a percentage, but final
   grades are letters. Let's write the code for the ``percentToLetter`` function. 
   ``percentToLetter`` takes a ``percentage`` and returns the corresponding
   letter grade. A 90% and above is an 'A', an 80% and above is a 'B', a 70% and above
   is a 'C', and anything under a 70% is an 'F'.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   char percentToLetter (double percentage) {
   =====
   void percentToLetter (double percentage) {  #distractor
   =====
   void percentToLetter (int percentage) {  #distractor
   =====
   char percentToLetter (percentage) {  #distractor
   =====
      if (percentage >= 90) {
   =====
         return 'A';
   =====
         return A;  #paired
   =====
      }
   =====
      else if (percentage >= 80) {
   =====
         return 'B';
   =====
         return 'B'  #paired
   =====
      }
   =====
      else if (percentage >= 70) {
   =====
      else if (percentage > 70) {  #paired
   =====
         return 'C';
   =====
      }
   =====
      else {
   =====
         return 'F';

      }

   Let's write the code for the ``triangleArea`` function. ``triangleArea``
   takes two parameters, ``base`` and ``height``. It returns the 
   area of the triangle using the formula **1/2 * base * height**.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   double triangleArea (double base, double height) {
   =====
   int triangleArea (double base, double height) {  #distractor
   =====
   void triangleArea (double base, double height) {  #distractor
   =====
   double triangleArea (base, height) {  #distractor
   =====
      double area;  #distractor
   =====
      return 0.5 * base * height;
   =====
      cout << 0.5 * base * height << endl;  #distractor
   =====

   Let's write the code for the ``cylinderVolume`` function. ``cylinderVolume``
   takes two parameters, ``radius`` and ``height``. It returns the 
   volume of the cylinder using the formula **pi * radius * radius * height**.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   double cylinderVolume (double radius, double height) {
   =====
   void cylinderVolume (double radius, double height) {  #distractor
   =====
   double cylinderVolume (radius, height) {  #distractor
   =====
      double pi = 3.14;
   =====
      return pi * radius * radius * height;
   =====

   Let's write a function called ``scale`` which takes an input ``x`` and scales it by a factor 
   of 2 is ``x`` is even and a factor of 3 if ``x`` is odd. The function should modify the original
   ``x`` variable, not return the scaled value.
   -----
   void scale(int &x) {
   =====
   void scale(int x) {  #distractor
   =====
   int scale(int x) {  #distractor
   =====
      if (x % 2 == 0) {

      if (x % 2) {  #paired
   =====
         x = x * 2;
   =====
      }
   =====
      return x * 2; #distractor

   Let's write the code for the ``compare`` function. The ``compare`` 
   function takes two integers ``a``, ``b``. ``compare`` returns ``1`` if 
   a is greater than b, ``-1`` if a is less than b and ``0`` if they are equal.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   int compare (int a, int b) {
   =====
   bool compare (int a, int b) {   #paired
