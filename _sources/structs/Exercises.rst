    What is wrong with the following ``struct`` definition?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Chicken {
        string name;
        int numLegs;
        int eggs;
        bool eggs;
      }

    - The word "struct" needs to be capitalized.

      - "struct" shouldn't be capitalized in a ``struct`` definition.

    - There needs to be a semicolon after the end curly brace.

      + It is a common error to forgot the semicolon at the end of ``struct`` definitions.

    - The ``struct`` cannot have two instance variables that are both named ``eggs``.

      - One is an ``int`` and one is a ``bool`` so this is allowed.

    - There is nothing wrong with the ``struct`` definition.

      - There is an error with the definition. Can you find it?

    How do we assign the value of 4 to the instance variable ``numLegs`` of the ``Dog`` object?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Dog {
        string name;
        int numLegs;
        bool isPanting;
      };

      int main() {
        Dog doug = { "Doug", 0, true };
      }

    - ``Dog.numLegs = 4;``

      - The ``Dog`` object is ``doug``. We can use the dot notation on an object.

    - ``doug.legs = 4;``

      - Check the name of the instance variable in the ``struct`` definition.

    - ``doug[legs] = 4;``

      - We can assign values to the instance variables of a ``struct`` using dot notation.

    - ``doug.numLegs = 4;``

      + Using dot notation on ``doug``, we can set the value of ``numLegs`` to 4.

    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Cube {
        int edgeLength;
        int volume;
        int mass;
      };

      int main() {
        Cube c;
        c.edgeLength = 4;
        c.volume = 64;
        c.mass = 128;
        cout << c.edgeLength << ", " << c.mass << ", " << c.volume << ", ";
        int density = c.mass / c.volume;
        cout << density;
      }

    - 4, 64, 128, 2

      - Check the ordering of the output statements.

    - 4, 128, 64

      - Take a closer look at the output statements.

    - 4, 128, 64, 2

      + The code outputs all instance variables and the density in the proper order.

    - edgeLength, volume, mass, density

      - Dot notation accesses the values of the instance variables, not the names.

.. mchoice:: structs_mcq_4
    :practice: T

    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Cube {
        int edgeLength;
        int volume;
        int mass;
      };

      int calculateDensity (const Cube &c) {
        return c.mass / c.volume;
      }

      int main() {
        Cube c = { 2, 8, 4 };
        int density = calculateDensity (c);
        cout << density;
      }

    - 0

      + Because of integer division, ``density`` is 0 and thus the output is 0.

    - 2

      - Density is mass divided by volume.

    - 0.5

      - Take a closer look at what kind of division we are doing.

    - 1

      - Integer division truncates the extra digits.

.. mchoice:: structs_mcq_5
    :practice: T

    What is the value of ``s.coffeeCupFull`` when the code is done running?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Student {
        string name;
        bool isSleepy;
        bool coffeeCupFull;
      };

      void pourCoffee (Student &s) {
        s.coffeeCupFull = true;
      }

      int main() {
        Student s = { "Thor Odinson", true, false };
        if (s.isSleepy) {
          pourCoffee (s);
        }
      }

    - true

      - C++ outputs boolean values as either a 0 or 1.

    - false

      - C++ outputs boolean values as either a 0 or 1.

    - 1

      + Since we pass a ``Student`` object by reference to ``pourCoffee``, the function modifies the original value of ``coffeeCupFull``.

    - 0

      - Take a closer look at the function definition of ``pourCoffee`` and how the ``Student`` struct is passed through it.

.. mchoice:: structs_mcq_7
    :practice: T

    What is the value of ``r.batteryLevelPercentage`` when the code is done running?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Robot {
        string name;
        int batteryLevelPercentage;
        bool isFullyCharged;
      };

      void chargeRobot (Robot& r) {
        if (r.batteryLevelPercentage + 50 > 100) {
          r.batteryLevelPercentage = 100;
          r.isFullyCharged = true;
        } else {
          r.batteryLevelPercentage = r.batteryLevelPercentage + 50;
        }
      }

      int main() {
        Robot r = { "Rob", 60, false };
        chargeRobot (r);
      }

    - 100

      + The ``Robot`` object is passed by reference to ``chargeRobot``, which caps the ``batteryLevelPercentage`` at 100.

    - 110

      - Take a closer look at the ``chargeRobot`` function.

    - 60

      - Is the ``Robot`` object passed by value or by reference to ``chargeRobot``?

    - 1

      - That is the final value of ``r.isFullyCharged``.
